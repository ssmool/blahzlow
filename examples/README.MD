## üì¶ Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install blahzlow
````

---

## üß™ First Time Setup: Creating the Boardtest Example

### Windows Setup

```bash
mkdir pyx_test_route.py
notepad pyx_test_route.py
```

### Linux Setup

```bash
mkdir pyx_test_route
python-pyx_test_route.py > pyx_test_route.py
```

---

## üßæ Paste the Example Code Below into `pyx_test_route.py`

```python
# Set Integer Array Init
app_i = [0]

# For Write STR Variable to Screen
def write(text):
    print(text)

# For append Integer to app_i Array 
def app_lst(i):
    app_i.append(i)

# For write File with set param WriteFile('file.txt')
def WriteFile(file, content):
    f = open(file, "a")
    f.write(content)
    f.close()

# For Thrown error to results with app_lst_err(-1)
def app_lst_err(i):
    _r = app_i[i]
```

Save and close the file.

## üöÄ Roadmap to Run Blahzlow Workflow Boardtest

### ‚úÖ **Step 1**: Initialize Environment

```python
# Start environment work
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 2**: Set Up Execution Start

```python
set_start('pyx_test_route_v0_tx_001_ax', '#asytrick')
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 3**: Configure Task to Check

```python
_step_x = "write('hello world');app_lst(1);WriteFile('stream_writer_test.txt','success_x_0:01:x');app_lst_err(-1)"
_step_x_y = ['hello world', 1, 'stream_writer_test.txt', 'success_x_0:01:x', -1]
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 3.1**: Setup Workflow Dictionary

```python
_step_ax = {
    "NAME": "pyx_test_route_v0_x01_txt",
    "FILE": "pyx_test_route.py",
    "STEP": "0",
    "MV": _step_x,
    "VAL": _step_x_y,
    "DESC": "ROADMAP TO TEST pyx_test_route.py V0x1A:0x00"
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 4**: Append Step to Workflow

```python
set_blahjz_mv(_step_ax)
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 5**: Write Execution File (BAT)

```python
set_write_exec()
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 6**: Execute Workflow

```python
set_exec_bat()
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 7**: View Results in Web Viewer

```python
get_result_viewer('result_file_path', type='WEBVIEW')
```
