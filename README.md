## 🔍 Overview

**Blahzlow** is an automated testing system for Python developers, specially designed to integrate smoothly into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines and Gen-AI Engineering environments.

This tool enables automation and management of `.py` script tests using `.blahjz` config files and customizable workflows with results visualization (Pandas or WebView). It also supports interactive test compositions and batch execution.

Blahzlow is also a component of the **CineOS Barsotti** suite — a Unix-like ecosystem for automated test and AI scripting orchestration. Stay tuned for upcoming releases at **@buskplay**.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Install the Package**

```bash
[# pip install blahzlowv01a #underconstruction for comming soon]
````

**Step 2: Initialize Your Test Environment**

```python
set_start(path_to_output_folder, author_signature)
```

**Step 3: Configure the First Test Step**

```python
set_config_mv('blahzlow_test_x01_step_x01.blahjz')
```

Example content:

```json
{
  "NAME": "TEST_TO_DO_VX",
  "FILE": "app_type.py",
  "STEP": 1,
  "MV": "MY_DEF_METHOD_NAME",
  "VAL": "'param_0_1','param_0_2',0",
  "DESC": "ABOUT RUN OF THIS STEP"
}
```

**Step 4: Load the Model Configuration**

```python
set_config_model('myxpplx_test_x01_step_x01.blahjz')
```

> Load your model-based test blueprint from `test_model/blahzlow__test_x01_step_x01.blahjz`.

**Step 5: Write the Execution Script**

```python
set_write_exec()
```

> This generates a `.bat` file to automate your test pipeline.

**Step 6: Execute the Test**

```python
set_exec_bat('_exec_bat_file_test_x_01.bat')
# or just
set_exec_bat()
```

> Executes the latest or newly generated `.bat` file.

**Step 7 (Optional - Interactive Mode):**

```python
set_blahjz_mv('blahzlow_test_x01_step_x01.blahjz')
```

> Append new steps interactively to your current testboard plan.

**Step 8: View Results**

```python
get_result_viewer('result_file_path', type='PANDAS')
# or
get_result_viewer('result_file_path', type='WEBVIEW')
```
